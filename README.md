## Predicting Credit Card Applications
Commercial banks have the task of deciding whether or not credit card applications are successful or not. The teams in charge have to make a judgement call based on the profile of the applicant. Applicants may be rejected for a variety of reasons; high loan balances, low income level and poor credit history are some of the typical reasons application are unsuccessful. Traditionally, these applications are reviewed manually, in a case-by-case fashion. Here, we will train a **(supervised) machine learning classifier** to predict the outcome of applications - eliminating the time-consuming process of manual reviews.

The data used to train and test our classifiers is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. Below are the sub tasks performed in order to successfully build and assess the supervised learning model:

 1. Exploratory Analysis
 2. Feature selection
 3. Split the data into train and test sets
 4. Preprocessing the data
 5. Train a few classic models
 6. Cross Fold Validation
 7. Hyper Parameter Tuning to improve model performance
 8. Impementing Ensemble methods to improve model performance
 9. Testing the chosen model on unseen data
